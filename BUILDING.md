# ğŸ¦¾ Building Graviton

Prerequisites:

- Git installed

Instructions to build Graviton from the source:

## 1 - Downloading the source

Clone the git repository:
> $ git clone https://github.com/Graviton-Code-Editor/Graviton-App.git

There are 2 different branches:
* Master: daily source (maybe unstable).
* Stable: this doesn't mean it's ready to be released as stable build , peroit doesn't have that many bugs, in general it's more stable.

## 2 - Installing the dependencies

Go inside the folder:
> $ cd Graviton-App

### Windows

Run as admin:
> $ npm --global --production install windows-build-tools

Install the dependencies:
> $ npm install

Rebuild a dependency:
> $ npm run rebuild

### Linux

You must have Python 2.7 installed.

Install the dependencies:
> $ npm install

Rebuild a dependency:
> $ npm run rebuild

### MacOS

## 3 - Building 

### Testing

In case you just wanna test it, run:

> $ npm start

### Windows

- From a Windows machine:

> $ npm run build 

- From a Windows or Linux machine for 32-bits Windows:

> $ npm run build:win32

- From a Linux machine with Wine: 

>  $ npm run build:win 

### Linux

- From a Linux machine: 

>  $ npm run build 

This will build an AppImage file. It works on all the linux distros and works like a Windows' portable program.
You can learn more about AppImages here: https://appimage.org/

If you want to build an specific package for your distribution (with i recommend) try this command

>  $ npm run build:packageExtensionHere

You can choose between snap, deb, apk, freebsd, p5p, rpm and pacman.
For example if you want to build this for your Ubuntu machine type this:

>  $ npm run build:deb

You can also build packages for other distros but sometimes you will need to install some dependencies. For example if you 
want to build a npm package for your RedHat-like distro with your Ubuntu machine you need to install this:

> $ sudo apt-get install rpm

And then just build it like shown before

>  $ npm run build:rpm

   

### MacOS

- From a Macintosh: 

>  $ npm run build
