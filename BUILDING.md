# ðŸ¦¾ Building Graviton

Prerequisites:

- NodeJS (LTS version)
- Git

## Getting the source

Clone the git repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Graviton-Code-Editor/Graviton-App.git --depth 1
```

**Important**: There are 3 different branches:

- `master`: daily source (default).
- `stable`: this doesn't mean it's ready to be released as stable build , but it doesn't have that many bugs, it's more stable overall.
- `1.3.0`: it refers to the old Graviton source code.

## Installing dependencies

Go inside the folder:

```shell
cd Graviton-App
```

Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

## Developing (optional)

In case you just want to test it in development mode, run:

```shell
npm start
```

If shows an empty dark screen just wait.

## Building the installer

Default outputs:

- Windows: 64 bits
- Linux: Deb and AppImage
- MacOS: DMG

Run:

```shell
npm run build
```

You can override the default outputs in the package.json, or just skip to the next section.

#### Building specific Linux installers

If you want to build a specific linux Installer for your distro you can run:

```shell
npm run build:whatever_package
```

For example, if you are an Arch Linux user, run:

```shell
npm run build:pacman
```

Here is the list of the supported packages:

- snap
- pacman
- deb
- apk
- freebsd
- p5p
- rpm
- AppImage

Please keep in mind that any distribution can build for every platform. For example, you can build for AppImage and Deb in Debian-based distros, like Ubuntu.

#### Building out-packed

In case you want to test Graviton in a production build but don't want to create an installer, you can build an outpacked version, this builds faster than an installer.

Run:

```shell
npm run build:outpacked
```
