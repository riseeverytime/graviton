# Introduction
Gravitons is a modularized code editor, meaning that the different modules can be used together to build different kind of editors. By design, it's a frontend-agnostic editor, so multiple frontends can be built on it.

Modules:
- Core: The backend
- Web: A web-based frontend implementation
- Desktop: A webview-based app that handles running the core and the web frontend
- Cli: a CLI to easily launch and manage a core instance
