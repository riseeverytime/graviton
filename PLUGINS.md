# Installing plugins

Let's navigate to our .graviton folder:


| OS   			| Path |
| --------- | ---- |
| Windows   | C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\\.graviton |
| Linux 		| /home/username/.config/.graviton |
| MacOS     | /users/username/library/applications support/.graviton |

And there we have to copy the Plugin's folder(you can also run a "git clone").
