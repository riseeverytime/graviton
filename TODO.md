- [ ] Make a web-based filesystem explorer component
- [x] Make use of the native (OS-builtin) filesystem explorer to open folder and files
- [ ] Also return the language codename or "unknown" when reading a file in the Core
- [ ] Implement a workspace system
- [ ] Implement a frontend-agnostic theme standard
- [ ] Implement frontend-only extensions (through the Core ?)
- [ ] Document the Core JSON RPC and WebSockets API
- [ ] Make some useful components of the web-based frontend as a React library
- [ ] Make the JSON RPC & WebSockets client as a separate library
- [ ] Don't start a new Core on the Desktop app when it detects that there is one already running
- [ ] Register a new Token::All token on the Core by passing an existing already-used (by another frontend) token, so a new frontend can make use of it (idea)
- [x] Think about using CORS to maximize security of Core
