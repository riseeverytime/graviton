Known problems
---
- After updating Graviton with a new version,  it will probably throw an error. That is happening cause I am introducing & removing some values in the config.json in some updates, so after you install a new version it doesn't detect these values, so, it gets "undefined". Fix: Remove the .graviton folder from your system and reboot Graviton.
